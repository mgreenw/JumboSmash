  <h3>Safety Tips</h3>

  <p>We strongly suggest that you follow these steps but please remember that you know yourself best and are the judge of your personal safety. Always remember to follow your own common sense.</p>

  <h5>Online Behavior</h5>

  <strong>Protect Your Finances</strong>
  <p>Never send money to anyone you meet on the internet, even if they claim it’s an emergency. For more information on how scammers use dating apps to get money out of their victims, check out the Federal Trade Commission’s <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0004-online-dating-scams">video</a> on online dating scams.</p>

  <strong>Protect Your Info:</strong>
  <p>Never give personal information to anyone you don’t know or haven’t met in person. Personal information means your credit card number, bank info, social security number, personal address, or anything else sensitive.</p>

  <strong>Keep An Eye Out For Bad People:</strong>
  <p>You can block or report anyone at any time and for any reason on JumboSmash, and we encourage you to do so if you come across someone who looks like they’re up to no good. It’s also smart to keep your conversations on the app-- this way, we have a record of what happened.</p>
  <p>Generally, you should report someone if you see them violating our <a href="https://jumbosmash.com/terms.html">Terms and Conditions</a>. Some examples of terms and conditions violations are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>People under 18 using the app</li>
    <li>Fake profiles or “catfish”</li>
    <li>Users sending harassing or offensive messages</li>
    <li>Users behaving inappropriately after meeting in person</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
  <h5>IRL Behavior</h5>

  <p>We hope you use JumboSmash to actually meet some new people! Remember to stay smart and follow these tips to be as safe as possible:</p>

  <strong>Get to Know Your Date:</strong>
  <p>Make sure you interact with them enough before you agree to meet up to make sure there’s nothing fishy going on. Also, limit your communication with this person to the JumboSmash app-- that way, if something goes wrong, we can help.</p>

  <strong>Meet Up in Public:</strong>
  <p>The first time you meet someone, stay in public in case anything goes wrong. It’s also a good idea to stay sober so that you can have a clear mind to make important decisions. If you’re feeling uncomfortable or want to leave, do so immediately. You don’t owe anything to anyone!</p>

  <strong>Loop in Your Friends:</strong>
  <p>Let your friends know when you’re meeting up with someone, who they are, and where you’ll be.</p>

  <strong>Make Your Own Transportation Plans:</strong>
  <p>It’s always a good idea to be responsible for your own transportation! Make sure you have a way of getting to and from the meeting spot so that you aren’t dependent on your date, especially in case things don’t work out.</p>

  <h5>Health</h5>

  <p>We’re committed to building a fun and safe environment for all Tufts seniors, and part of this means ensuring proper sexual health and safety. Use common sense, and make sure to:</p>

  <strong>Use Protection:</strong>
  <p>You and your partner should always protect yourselves during sex. Consistent use of condoms, dental dams, and/or other mechanisms for safe sex is a must.</p>

  <strong>Stay Honest:</strong>
  <p>It’s normal and a very good idea to talk to your partner about sex and sexual health, even before you you hook up. Consider discussing when you were last tested, who else you’re having sex with, and what you are/are not comfortable with doing.</p>

  <strong>Get Vaccinated:</strong>
  <p>You can reduce the risk of contracting some STIs with vaccinations. Ask your doctor, or a professional at Health Services or a sexual health clinic to find out more.</p>

  <strong>Get Tested:</strong>
  <p>Some STIs don’t show symptoms, so even if you think you’re in the clear, it’s important to get regularly tested. Health Services is always a good option, or you can use <a href="https://gettested.cdc.gov/">Healthvana’s free HIV and STD testing locator</a> to find free and confidential testing options near you.</p>
